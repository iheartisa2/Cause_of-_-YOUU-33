1
00:00:11,356 --> 00:00:17,028
I was lost before I knew what living felt like Breathing didn't mean I was alive

2
00:00:17,121 --> 00:00:19,910
I was falling, I was stalling Every second felt like crawling

3
00:00:20,004 --> 00:00:22,752
I was smiling just to hide it But the silence kept on calling

4
00:00:22,846 --> 00:00:25,662
I was drowning in my head Every thought was getting violent

5
00:00:25,756 --> 00:00:28,504
I was wishing I'd go numb Just to make the noise go quiet

6
00:00:28,598 --> 00:00:31,387
I was tired of the mornings Tried to wake in just to ache

7
00:00:31,481 --> 00:00:34,269
I was praying for an end And I was scared enough to take

8
00:00:34,363 --> 00:00:36,991
I was living in a mirror Where I couldn't see my face

9
00:00:37,085 --> 00:00:39,861
Just a body full of damage Trying to occupy some space

10
00:00:39,955 --> 00:00:42,824
And I didn't want to die I just didn't want to stay

11
00:00:42,917 --> 00:00:45,666
In a life where every breath Felt borrowed anyway

12
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,589
I was standin’ on the edge, not to jump but to escape

13
00:00:48,683 --> 00:00:51,592
From a mind that kept on tellin’ me I’d never be okay

14
00:00:51,686 --> 00:00:55,588
But you, you saw the light in me When I was seeing none

15
00:00:55,681 --> 00:00:58,390
You held my hand when every part of me would run

16
00:00:58,484 --> 00:01:02,385
You turned the nights I wanted Gone into the nights I survived

17
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:07,386
You didn't save my life But you showed me why

18
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:12,387
And you, you took my worst point And made it something real

19
00:01:12,481 --> 00:01:14,989
You made me want to wake up Just to see how joy can feel

20
00:01:15,082 --> 00:01:19,386
Now I'm standing where the sky Don't feel so far above

21
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:24,387
I was down there with the shadows Now I'm up here learning love

22
00:01:24,481 --> 00:01:27,391
I was buried in the past Every memory away

23
00:01:27,485 --> 00:01:30,193
Every it'll get better Felt a little bit too late

24
00:01:30,287 --> 00:01:32,982
I would stare into the dark Like it understood my pain

25
00:01:33,075 --> 00:01:35,784
Like the void was the only thing That never looked away

26
00:01:35,878 --> 00:01:38,787
Then you walked in like a sunrise I didn't plan to see

27
00:01:38,881 --> 00:01:41,589
Didn't ask me to be perfect Just to stay and try with me

28
00:01:41,683 --> 00:01:44,391
You ain't fix me with a sentence You ain't rush me through the hurt

29
00:01:44,485 --> 00:01:47,180
You just sat with all my broken Showed me I still had some worth

30
00:01:47,274 --> 00:01:49,982
You never said I was weak For the thoughts in my head

31
00:01:50,076 --> 00:01:52,785
You just told me stay here When I wanted to end

32
00:01:52,878 --> 00:01:55,587
And I hate how close I came To never knowing your name

33
00:01:55,681 --> 00:01:58,590
But I'm here and that's proof That I don't think the same

34
00:01:58,684 --> 00:02:02,586
Cause you, you saw the light in me When I was seeing none

35
00:02:02,679 --> 00:02:05,589
You held my hand When every part of me would run

36
00:02:05,683 --> 00:02:09,584
You turned the nights I wanted Gone into the nights I survived

37
00:02:09,678 --> 00:02:14,585
You didn't save my life But you showed me why

38
00:02:14,679 --> 00:02:19,989
And you, you made a future Feel like something I could choose

39
00:02:20,082 --> 00:02:22,187
Turned my fear into a reason not to lose

40
00:02:22,281 --> 00:02:26,384
Now I wake up feeling proud of Just staying alive

41
00:02:26,478 --> 00:02:31,184
I was down there with the demons Now I'm up here, I'm alright

42
00:02:31,278 --> 00:02:36,587
Some days the thoughts still whisper low Like echoes from a life I used to know

43
00:02:36,681 --> 00:02:39,993
But now they don't control the room They just knock

44
00:02:40,087 --> 00:02:42,782
I don't let them through Cause I've seen

45
00:02:42,875 --> 00:02:46,388
What it's like to feel okay I felt peace, sit still

46
00:02:46,482 --> 00:02:49,982
And actually stay And when my mind starts slipping back

47
00:02:50,075 --> 00:02:52,784
I remember how you pulled me back

48
00:02:52,878 --> 00:02:55,787
I was breaking, now I'm building I was scared of all my feelings

49
00:02:55,881 --> 00:02:58,589
I was stuck inside the question Now I'm living in the meaning

50
00:02:58,683 --> 00:03:01,392
I don't say I'm here forever But I'm better than before

51
00:03:01,485 --> 00:03:04,784
I don't beg the night to end I don't hate the morning anymore

52
00:03:04,877 --> 00:03:07,988
And if I ever start forgetting What it took to get me here

53
00:03:08,082 --> 00:03:12,989
I'll remember how you stood beside me When my future disappeared

54
00:03:13,083 --> 00:03:16,984
Cause you, you saw the light in me When I was seeing none

55
00:03:17,078 --> 00:03:19,787
You held my hand When every part of me would run

56
00:03:19,881 --> 00:03:23,782
You turned the nights I wanted gone Into the nights I survived

57
00:03:23,876 --> 00:03:28,783
You didn't save my life But you showed me why

58
00:03:28,877 --> 00:03:34,187
And now Now I'm breathing like the world don't want me gone

59
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:37,190
Now I'm dreaming like my heart can still move on

60
00:03:37,284 --> 00:03:42,781
I was falling, I was lost I was ready to say goodbye

61
00:03:42,875 --> 00:03:48,788
Now I'm here, and I'm happy I stayed alive

62
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:56,765
I was down there Thinking I'd never get free

63
00:03:57,341 --> 00:04:05,748
Now I’m up here… And life finally feels like me
